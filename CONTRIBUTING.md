## Hello, Wiki Bobikky contributor!  Thanks for your interest.

* This file outlines our workflows for pull requests and code reviews
* All pull request merges must adhere to these protocols.
<br><br><br>

### Pull Request Workflow
1. Set git user (weare/iam)
2. Create a branch named for the feature/object you are working on
3. Write Code
4. Commit the code with a good commit message
5. Commits that include views must include screenshot(s)
6. Push the branch to Github
7. Create a Pull Request
8. Hand off to a Reviewer (a team member who did not write any of the code)

### Code Review Workflow

1. Reviewer inspects all changes in the pull request
2. If not satisfactory, Reviewer discusses defects with Submitter; close request without merging
3. If satisfactory, Reviewer adds comments on Github citing the review findings etc.
4. Reviewer merges the Pull Request

<br>
#### Review Findings
Comments should be brief but at the same time reflect the reviewer's findings as to whether the code makes sense,
adheres to style guidelines, and follows other relevant procedures.
